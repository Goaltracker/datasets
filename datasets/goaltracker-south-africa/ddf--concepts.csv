The SAMPI is based on four dimensions, namely health, education, living standards and economic activity. It is calculated based on the Alkire-Foster methodology used in the compilation of the global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). A household is classified as SAMPI poor if it is deprived in a third or more of the indicators in the index. There are two key measures relating to the South African Multidimensional Poverty Index (SAMPI), namely the headcount and intensity measures.","The SAMPI headcount is calculated by dividing the number of households that are multidimensionally poor by the total number of households in the country. A household is considered multidimensionally poor if the sum of its weighted deprivations across the four dimensions (health, education, living standards and economic activity) is 33,3% or more. The SAMPI intensity is the average proportion of weighted indicators in which “multidimensionally poor” households are deprived. It is calculated by dividing the number of deprivations of the multidimensionally poor households by the number of households that are multidimensionally poor.","Statistics South Africa,CENSUS and Community Survey, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2015"

The specified variables are oxygen, salinity, nitrogen, phosphorus and pH. Oxygen measurements for South African river systems and most dams are very scarce, this indicator therefor excludes oxygen and adds a local indicator of acid mine drainage, i.e. the ionic ratio of sulphate to total ions. In the case of rivers, waterbodies are tertiary catchments. For dams, each dam is a waterbody. Good water quality status refers to bodies of water that comply to the South African uniform water quality objectives","Classify the quality of individual water bodies using a simple index based on the compliance of the monitoring data with the selected target values. For all monitoring sites within a water body, i.e. tertiary drainage region or dam, compare the monitoring values with the target values. Data from sites with a minimum of four samples or more per year are used. The index is the percentage of monitoring values that comply with the target values: 𝐶𝑤𝑞 = (𝑛𝑐/𝑛𝑚) × 100; 𝐶𝑤𝑞 is the percentage compliance [%]; 𝑛𝑐 is the number of monitoring values in compliance with the target values; 𝑛𝑚 is the total number of monitoring values. A threshold value of 80% compliance is necessary for water bodies to have “good” quality. Thus, a body of water has a good quality status if at least 80% of all monitoring data from all monitoring stations within the water body are in compliance with the respective targets. Aggregate the results of the classification of single water bodies to the national level by calculating the proportion of classified water bodies classified as having a good quality status to the total number of classified water bodies. This is also a percentage: 𝑊𝐵𝐺𝑄 = (𝑛𝑔𝑛𝑡) × 100,𝑊𝐵𝐺𝑄 is the percentage of water bodies classified as having a good quality status; 𝑛𝑔 is the number of classified water bodies classified as having a good quality status; 𝑛𝑡 is the total number of monitored and classified water bodies","Department of Water and Sanitation,Water Management System (WMS)"

For the purpose of this indicator, “basin area” is defined for surface water as the extent of the catchment, and for groundwater as the extent of the aquifer. An “arrangement for water cooperation” is a bilateral or multilateral treaty, convention, agreement or other formal arrangement between riparian countries that provides a framework for cooperation on transboundary water management. The criteria for the arrangement to be considered “operational” are based on key aspects of substantive coo¬peration in water management: the existence of a joint body, regular, formal communication between riparian countries (at least once a year), joint or coordinated management plans or objectives and a regular exchange of data and information (at least once a year).","Transboundary basins (rivers and lakes and aquifers) of the country’s territory and with the following information for each of them: the country with which the basin is shared; the surface area of these basins (the catchment of rivers or lakes and the aquifer in the case of groundwater) within the territory of your country (in km2); the surface area of these basins within the territory of your country which is covered by a cooperation arrangement that is operational according to the above criteria (please consider the replies to the questions in Section II, in particular questions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6).
